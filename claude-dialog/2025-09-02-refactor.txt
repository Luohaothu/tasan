● The LSan files were copied but the build is still failing because the ASan source files are looking for LSan headers
  in the wrong location. Let me check what was actually copied and fix the include paths.

● Bash(ls -la src/)
  ⎿  total 40                                 
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo 4096 Sep  2 16:43 .
     drwxrwxr-x 9 leo leo 4096 Sep  2 16:41 ..
     … +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good, LSan was copied. Let me check what's in the LSan directory:

● Bash(ls -la src/lsan/)
  ⎿  total 204                                 
     drwxrwxr-x 2 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:43 .
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:43 ..
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The LSan files are there. The issue is that the ASan source files are looking for lsan/lsan_common.h but the
  include path needs to be adjusted. Let me check the include paths in the ASan CMakeLists.txt:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is that the ASan CMakeLists.txt has include_directories(..) which includes the parent directory (src/), but
  the ASan source files are looking for lsan/lsan_common.h. This should work since the LSan directory is in src/. Let me
   check what the actual include looks like in the ASan source:

● Search(pattern: "#include.*lsan.*lsan_common\.h", path: "src/asan", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "lsan_common\.h", path: "src/asan", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me check one of the failing files to see the exact include:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/asan_allocator.cpp)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue! The include is #include "lsan/lsan_common.h" which should work since we have the lsan directory in
  src/. Let me check if there's a CMakeLists.txt in the lsan directory that needs to be included:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/lsan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Bash(cat src/lsan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  include_directories(..)                    

     set(LSAN_CFLAGS ${SANITIZER_COMMON_CFLAGS})
     … +86 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The LSan CMakeLists.txt exists and creates the RTLSanCommon object library that the ASan build needs. However,
  the LSan directory is not being included in the build. Let me check the main CMakeLists.txt to add the LSan
  subdirectory:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check the src/CMakeLists.txt to see if it includes the LSan subdirectory:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Found the issue! The LSan subdirectory is not included in the src/CMakeLists.txt. Let me add it:

● Update(~/projects/tasan/src/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Updated ../src/CMakeLists.txt with 2 additions and 1 removal
       1    # Main source directory CMakeLists.txt
       2    add_subdirectory(asan)
       3    add_subdirectory(sanitizer_common)
       4 -  add_subdirectory(interception)
       4   \ No newline at end of file
       5 +  add_subdirectory(interception)
       6 +  add_subdirectory(lsan)
       7   \ No newline at end of file

● Now I need to configure CMake again to include the new LSan subdirectory and test the build:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (add_subdirectory):
       add_subdirectory given source "lsan" which is not an existing directory.



     -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

● The error suggests that the LSan directory doesn't exist in the build context. Let me check if there's a symbolic link
   issue or if we need to clean the build directory:

● Bash(ls -la src/lsan/)
  ⎿  total 204                                 
     drwxrwxr-x 2 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:43 .
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:43 ..
     … +24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The directory exists. This might be a CMake cache issue. Let me clean the build directory and reconfigure:

● Bash(rm -rf * && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake:572 (install):
       install FILES given no DESTINATION!
     Call Stack (most recent call first):
       src/asan/CMakeLists.txt:387 (add_compiler_rt_resource_file)


     CMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (add_subdirectory):
       add_subdirectory given source "lsan" which is not an existing directory.


     … +32 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

● There are two errors:
  1. LSan directory not found (which is strange since it exists)
  2. Missing DESTINATION for install files

  Let me check if we're in the right directory and check the source location:

● Bash(pwd && ls -la src/)
  ⎿  /home/leo/projects/tasan/build          
     total 24
     drwxrwxr-x 6 leo leo 4096 Sep  2 16:48 .
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue! When I run ls -la src/ from the build directory, it's showing the build directory's src folder, not
  the source directory. The LSan directory only exists in the source tree, not in the build directory. CMake is looking
  at the build directory structure.

  Let me check the actual source directory:

● Bash(ls -la ../src/)
  ⎿  total 32                                   
     drwxrwxr-x  5 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:47 .
     drwxrwxr-x 12 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:38 ..
     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The LSan directory doesn't exist in the source directory! Let me copy it again to the correct location:

● Bash(cp -r ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/lsan ../src/)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Now let me verify it was copied correctly:

● Bash(ls -la ../src/)
  ⎿  total 36                                   
     drwxrwxr-x  6 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:48 .
     drwxrwxr-x 12 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:38 ..
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now let me reconfigure CMake:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake:572 (install):
       install FILES given no DESTINATION!
     Call Stack (most recent call first):
       src/asan/CMakeLists.txt:387 (add_compiler_rt_resource_file)



     -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

● Good progress! The LSan directory issue is resolved, but now there's an install destination issue. Let me fix this by
  checking what's causing the install error:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is with the add_compiler_rt_resource_file function. Let me check if the asan_ignorelist.txt file exists and
  if the function is properly defined:

● Bash(ls -la ../src/asan/asan_ignorelist.txt)
  ⎿  -rw-rw-r-- 1 leo leo 703 Sep  2 16:00 ../src/asan/asan_ignorelist.txt

● The file exists. Let me check the add_compiler_rt_resource_file function in our localized CMake modules:

● Search(pattern: "add_compiler_rt_resource_file", path: "cmake/Modules", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● The function is not defined in our localized modules. Let me check if it's defined in the original LLVM files and copy
   it:

● Bash(find ../llvm-project -name "*.cmake" -exec grep -l "add_compiler_rt_resource_file" {} \;)
  ⎿  ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake

● Let me check if this function exists in our localized AddCompilerRT.cmake and if not, copy it from the original:

● Search(pattern: "add_compiler_rt_resource_file", path: "cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● I need to find and copy this function. Let me search for it in the original file:

● Bash(grep -n "add_compiler_rt_resource_file" ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿  563:macro(add_compiler_rt_resource_file target_name file_name component)

● Let me copy this function from the original file:

● Bash(sed -n '563,580p' ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake >> cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿  Error: /bin/bash: line 1: cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake: No such file or directory

● Let me use the correct path:

● Bash(sed -n '563,580p' ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake >>
      ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me check what was added:

● Bash(tail -20 ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿    configure_lit_site_cfg(${input} ${output})                        
     endfunction()
     macro(add_compiler_rt_resource_file target_name file_name component)
     … +17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The function was added successfully. Now let me reconfigure CMake:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake:842 (macro):
       Flow control statements are not properly nested.
     Call Stack (most recent call first):
       CMakeLists.txt:17 (include)



     -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

● There's a CMake syntax error. Let me check the structure around line 842:

● Bash(sed -n '835,850p' ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿      DESTINATION ${COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR}
         COMPONENT ${component})
       add_dependencies(${component} ${target_name})
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue might be that there's a missing endif() or other control structure. Let me check if there's an incomplete
  macro or function before line 842:

● Bash(sed -n '820,845p' ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿   string(REPLACE ${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR} ${LLVM_BUILD_MODE} COMPILER_RT_RESOLVED_EXEC_OUTPUT_DIR ${COMPILER_RT_EXEC_OUT
    PUT_DIR})
      string(REPLACE ${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR} ${LLVM_BUILD_MODE} COMPILER_RT_RESOLVED_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIR ${output_dir})
    … +21 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● I see the issue! There are nested macro definitions. The file already had a macro(add_compiler_rt_script name)
  definition, and I added another macro(add_compiler_rt_resource_file...) which is causing a nesting issue. Let me check
   if there was already an add_compiler_rt_resource_file macro:

● Bash(grep -n "add_compiler_rt_resource_file" ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿  563:macro(add_compiler_rt_resource_file target_name file_name component)
     825:macro(add_compiler_rt_resource_file target_name file_name component)

● There are two definitions! I need to remove the duplicate. Let me remove the second one:

● Bash(sed -i '825,844d' ../cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Now let me reconfigure CMake:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake:572 (install):
       install FILES given no DESTINATION!
     Call Stack (most recent call first):
       src/asan/CMakeLists.txt:387 (add_compiler_rt_resource_file)



     -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

● We're back to the original error. The issue is that COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR is not defined. Let me check what
  variables are needed and add them to our config:

● Search(pattern: "COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR", path: "cmake", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me check the original LLVM config files to see how this variable is defined:

● Bash(grep -r "COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR" ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/)
  ⎿ ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/base-config-ix.cmake:set(COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR "${default_install_path}" C
    ACHE PATH
    ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/AddCompilerRT.cmake:    DESTINATION ${COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR}


● Let me check the base-config-ix.cmake file to see how it's defined:

● Bash(grep -A5 -B5 "COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_DATA_DIR" ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/base-config-ix.cmake)
  ⎿    "Path where built compiler-rt executables should be installed.")

     set(COMPILER_RT_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR "${default_install_path}" CACHE PATH
     … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to add this variable definition to our config. Let me add it to cmake/config-ix.cmake:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/cmake/config-ix.cmake)
  ⎿  Read 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me add the missing variable definitions:

● Now let me also need to add the COMPILER_RT_OUTPUT_DIR variable. Let me add it:

● Update(~/projects/tasan/cmake/config-ix.cmake)
  ⎿  Updated ../cmake/config-ix.cmake with 1 addition

● Great progress! The LSan issue is resolved and most components are building successfully. However, there are still
  missing UBSan (UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer) headers. Let me copy the UBSan source files as well:

● Bash(cp -r ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/ubsan ../src/)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Now I need to add the UBSan subdirectory to the build:

● Great! The UBSan headers are now found and the ASan libraries are building successfully! The only remaining issue is
  that the examples are failing to link because they can't find -lclang_rt.asan. This suggests that the shared library
  isn't being built or installed in the right location.

  Let me check what libraries were actually built:

● Bash(ls -la lib/)
  ⎿  total 96                                  
     drwxrwxr-x 2 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 16:59 .
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 17:00 ..
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue! The shared library clang_rt.asan isn't being built, only the static versions. Looking at the build
  output, I can see that RTAsan_dynamic.x86_64 was built successfully, but the shared library wasn't created from it.
  This is likely because we're on Linux and the shared library creation might be failing.

  Let me check if there are any shared library files:

● Bash(find . -name "*clang_rt.asan*" -type f)
  ⎿  ./lib/libclang_rt.asan-preinit-x86_64.a
     ./lib/libclang_rt.asan_static-x86_64.a
     ./lib/libclang_rt.asan_cxx-x86_64.a

● The shared library isn't being built. This might be because the shared library target is only created for certain
  platforms or conditions. Let me check the ASan CMakeLists.txt to see why the shared library isn't being built on
  Linux:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me look for where the shared library is defined:

● Search(pattern: "clang_rt.asan.*SHARED", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "SHARED", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me search for the shared library creation more broadly:

● Search(pattern: "add_compiler_rt_runtime.*clang_rt.asan", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me look at the APPLE section which seems to have different logic:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see! The shared library is only built for APPLE platforms. For Linux, it builds static libraries. Let me check the
  non-APPLE section to see if there's a shared library build there:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/src/asan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I found the issue. The shared library is built in the non-APPLE section (lines 310-327), but it depends on
  COMPILER_RT_HAS_VERSION_SCRIPT being set. Let me check if this variable is defined in our configuration:

● Search(pattern: "COMPILER_RT_HAS_VERSION_SCRIPT", path: "cmake", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● The variable isn't defined. Let me add it to our config-ix.cmake:

● Update(~/projects/tasan/cmake/config-ix.cmake)
  ⎿  Updated ../cmake/config-ix.cmake with 3 additions                   
       114    # Set architecture-specific flags
       115    set(TARGET_x86_64_CFLAGS "-m64")
       116    
       117 +  # Set compiler feature flags
       118 +  set(COMPILER_RT_HAS_VERSION_SCRIPT TRUE)
       119 +  
       120    # Output directories for built libraries
       121    set(COMPILER_RT_OUTPUT_LIBRARY_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib)
       122    set(COMPILER_RT_OUTPUT_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})

● Now let me also need to add some other missing variables that the shared library build might need. Let me check what
  other variables are referenced:

● Search(pattern: "COMPILER_RT_HAS_.*SCRIPT", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me check for other potentially missing variables by looking at the ASAN_DYNAMIC_LIBS variable:

● Search(pattern: "ASAN_DYNAMIC_LIBS", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me look at the ASAN_DYNAMIC_LINK_FLAGS:

● Search(pattern: "ASAN_DYNAMIC_LINK_FLAGS", path: "src/asan/CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Let me just reconfigure and build to see if the VERSION_SCRIPT flag helps:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON && make -j$(nproc))
  ⎿  Error: CMake Error at src/asan/CMakeLists.txt:291 (add_sanitizer_rt_version_list):
       Unknown CMake command "add_sanitizer_rt_version_list".



     -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

● Another missing function! I need to find and copy the add_sanitizer_rt_version_list function. Let me search for it:

● Bash(find ../llvm-project -name "*.cmake" -exec grep -l "add_sanitizer_rt_version_list" {} \;)
  ⎿  ../llvm-project/compiler-rt/cmake/Modules/SanitizerUtils.cmake

● Let me check if we have this file in our localized modules:

● Bash(ls ../cmake/Modules/ | grep Sanitizer)
  ⎿  SanitizerUtils.cmake

● Good, we have it. Let me check if the function is defined:

● Search(pattern: "add_sanitizer_rt_version_list", path: "../cmake/Modules/SanitizerUtils.cmake", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● The function exists. The issue is that the SanitizerUtils.cmake module isn't being included. Let me check the main
  CMakeLists.txt to see if it includes SanitizerUtils:

● Search(pattern: "SanitizerUtils", path: "CMakeLists.txt", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● I need to include SanitizerUtils in the main CMakeLists.txt:

● Update(~/projects/tasan/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Updated ../CMakeLists.txt with 1 addition              
       16    include(CompilerRTUtils)
       17    include(AddCompilerRT)
       18    include(HandleCompilerRT)
       19 +  include(SanitizerUtils)
       20    include(CMakeDependentOption)
       21    
       22    # Configure platform and architecture detection

● Now let me reconfigure and build:

● Bash(cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTASAN_BUILD_TESTS=ON && make -j$(nproc))
  ⎿  Error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lclang_rt.asan: No such file or directory
     /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lclang_rt.asan: No such file or directory

● Excellent! Now the shared library libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.a was built successfully! The only remaining issue is that
  the examples are still looking for -lclang_rt.asan but the actual library is named libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.a.

  Let me check what libraries are available now:

● Bash(ls -la lib/)
  ⎿  total 3500                                  
     drwxrwxr-x 2 leo leo    4096 Sep  2 17:04 .
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo    4096 Sep  2 17:04 ..
     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The shared library is built. The issue is that the examples are linking with -lclang_rt.asan but the actual
  library file has the architecture suffix. Let me check the example CMakeLists.txt to see how they're linking:

● Read(~/projects/tasan/examples/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Read 24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to fix the linking to use the correct library name. Let me update the examples CMakeLists.txt:

● Update(~/projects/tasan/examples/CMakeLists.txt)
  ⎿  Updated ../examples/CMakeLists.txt with 1 addition and 1 removal    
        9    foreach(source ${EXAMPLE_SOURCES})
       10      get_filename_component(target_name ${source} NAME_WE)
       11      add_executable(${target_name} ${source})
       12 -    target_link_libraries(${target_name} clang_rt.asan)
       12 +    target_link_libraries(${target_name} clang_rt.asan-x86_64)
       13      set_target_properties(${target_name} PROPERTIES
       14        RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/examples
       15      )

● Now let me build just the examples to test:

● Bash(make examples)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Let me check if the examples were built:

● Bash(ls -la examples/)
  ⎿  total 28                                  
     drwxrwxr-x 3 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 17:04 .
     drwxrwxr-x 7 leo leo  4096 Sep  2 17:04 ..
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The examples directory doesn't contain the built executables. Let me check if they're in the root examples directory:

● Bash(find . -name "basic_usage" -type f)
  ⎿  (No content)

● The find command returned no results. Let me try to build the examples specifically:

● Bash(make basic_usage)
  ⎿  -- Configuring done (0.0s)                                         
     -- Generating done (0.1s)
     -- Build files have been written to: /home/leo/projects/tasan/build
     … +10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The basic_usage example built successfully. Let me check if it was created:

● Bash(find . -name "basic_usage" -type f)
  ⎿  ./examples/basic_usage

● Perfect! The example was built successfully. Let me test it to see if ASan is working:

● Bash(./examples/basic_usage)
  ⎿  Array values: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9         
     Basic ASan example completed successfully!

● Excellent! The basic example is working. Let me build the other examples and test the heap overflow detection:

● Bash(make heap_overflow_detection && ./examples/heap_overflow_detection)
  ⎿  [  4%] Built target RTInterception.x86_64
     [ 28%] Built target RTAsan.x86_64
     [ 30%] Built target RTAsan_preinit.x86_64
     … +10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! Let me test the use-after-free detection as well:

● Bash(make use_after_free_detection && ./examples/use_after_free_detection)
  ⎿  [  4%] Built target RTInterception.x86_64

     [ 30%] Built target RTAsan_preinit.x86_64
     … +11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! All examples are building and running successfully. Now let me update the todo list and run a final complete
  build to ensure everything is working:
